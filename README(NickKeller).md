In this assignment, we made a quiz of javascript terms.
This required a lot of dom manipulation.
We first made a html, with a layout of a soft header, declaring the quiz, that includes the start quiz button.
Within the start quiz button, the timer lies.
Below the start quiz, is the card that holds the actual quiz questions themselves, as well as possible answers, and buttons to select the answer the user wishes.
To the right of the 'quiz card', lies the high score card.
In the high score card, we included a cheezy arcade high score image, and below is the users high scores, ranked by highest to lowest.
When the user finishes the quiz, a hidden bar pops up below the quiz card where the user can imput their initials.
These initials are then moved into the high score card and saved to local memory.
So comments in index.html and script.js for more information.
